How to use?
==============
##Installation with Composer
Just add the line under `require` object in your `composer.json` file.
``` json
{
  "require": {
  ...
    "udokmeci/yii2-beanstalk" : "dev-master"
  }
}
```
then run 

``` console
$> composer update
```

##Configuration
Now add following lines in to your `main` and `console` configuration file under ```components``` 
``` php
'beanstalk'=>[
            'class' => 'udokmeci\yii2beanstalk\Beanstalk',
            'host'=> "127.0.0.1", // default host
            'port'=>11300, //default port
            'connectTimeout'=> 1,
            'sleep' => false, // or int for usleep after every job 
        ],
```

Now add following in to your `console` configuration only.

``` php
...
'params' => $params,
// add you controller with name and class name next to params.
'controllerMap' => [
        'worker'=>[
            'class' => 'app\commands\WorkerController',
        ]
       
    ],

```

##Producing
Now if everthing is fine. You can run ```beandstalkd```
and access to controller as 
``` php 
\Yii::$app->beanstalk
        ->putInTube('tube', $mixedData ,$priority,$delay);

```
`$mixedData` is added on v1.0 for complex usage. Anything else then `string` will be send as `json` format. So you can sent anything within it suppoted by `json`.

##Worker
for worker it also has a built in controller which runs an infinite loop and wait for new jobs. Most of the work is done in `BeanstalkController` . All you have to do is to create a controller and action like below.

###Controller
Create an controller under your `commands` folder. Give the name anything you want to it and `extend` your controller from `udokmeci\yii2beanstalk\BeanstalkController`
#####Example Controller

``` php
<?php
namespace app\commands;

use udokmeci\yii2beanstalk\BeanstalkController;
use yii\helpers\Console;
use Yii;

class WorkerController extends BeanstalkController
{
  // Those are the default values you can override

  const DELAY_PRIORITY = "1000"; //Default priority
  const DELAY_TIME = 5; //Default delay time

  // Used for Decaying. When DELAY_MAX reached job is deleted or delayed with 
  const DELAY_MAX = 3; 

  public function listenTubes(){
    return ["tube"];
  }

  /**
    *
    * @param Pheanstalk\Job $job
    * @return string  self::BURY
    *                 self::RELEASE
    *                 self::DELAY
    *                 self::DELETE
    *                 self::NO_ACTION
    *                 self::DECAY
    *  
    */
  public function actionTube($job){
	    $sentData = $job->getData();
	    try {
    	   // something useful here



           if($everthingIsAllRight == true){
                fwrite(STDOUT, Console::ansiFormat("- Everything is allright"."\n", [Console::FG_GREEN]));
                //Delete the job from beanstalkd
                return self::DELETE; 
           }

           if($everthingWillBeAllRight == true){
                fwrite(STDOUT, Console::ansiFormat("- Everything will be allright"."\n", [Console::FG_GREEN]));
                //Delay the for later try
                //You may prefer decay to avoid endless loop
                return self::DELAY; 
           }

           if($IWantSomethingCustom==true){
                Yii::$app->beanstalk->release($job);
                return self::NO_ACTION;
           }

           fwrite(STDOUT, Console::ansiFormat("- Not everything is allright!!!"."\n", [Console::FG_GREEN]));
           //Decay the job to try DELAY_MAX times.
           return self::DECAY; 

           // if you return anything else job is burried.
	    } catch (\Exception $e) {
            //If there is anything to do.
            fwrite(STDERR, Console::ansiFormat($e."\n", [Console::FG_RED]));
            // you can also bury jobs to examine later
            return self::BURY;
	    }
	}
}
```

#####Running Worker
Running console is the easiest part. Run ./yii Your ```controller```
``` console
php ./yii worker
```
Controller will tell you, wheater there are actions for correspanding tubes or beanstalk server is accessible and which tubes are listening currently. The controller handles with signals. So exit whenever you want, reserved job will not be hanged.

Any forks are welcome.
